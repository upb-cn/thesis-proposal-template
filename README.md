# BSc/MSc Thesis Proposal Template @ UPB-CN

This is the official template for writing thesis proposals at both the bachelor and master levels at the Computer Networks group at UPB. 

You can clone this repository with 

```bash
git clone --recursive REPO-URL
```

Please make sure you follow the guidelines and the instructions in the template closely. The high-level structure should not be changed, unless there is a good reason and you have already communicated it with your thesis supervisor(s).
